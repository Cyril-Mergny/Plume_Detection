# Plume_Detection

! Please note that this is an old project that cannot be used as is. To get the algorithm to fully work as intended you will need to **train it yourself with your own dataset**. Also take a look at the '.pdf' file to get an overview of the algorithm.

----------------------------------------------------

It should be self explanatory and very easy to use.
So even if you've never used python before, I made it as user friendly as possible.

Just unzip the folder and run the notebook (.ipynb file).
Also to run the notebook I recommend using Anaconda which includes the Jupiter Notebook app: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/.



The learner is perfectible, so if you're not happy with what you get let me know. 
I'll try training it with better data when I'll have the time.
