It should be self explanatory and very easy to use. Open the '.pdf' file to get an overview of the algorithm.
So even if you've never used python before, I made it as user friendly as possible.

Just unzip the folder and run the notebook (.ipynb file).
Also to run the notebook I recommend using Anaconda which includes the Jupiter Notebook app: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/.

The learner is perfectible, so if you're not happy with what you get let me know. 
I'll try training it with better data when I'll have the time.
